"""Local storage of the resource files that coordinate finding downloads.

Every remote resource (e.g. PPM's and osm-powerplants' CSVs, Natural Earth's zip, GEM's
fallback trackers) is kept in its own subfolder of the run's ``resources_dir``. Repeated
runs then reuse one pinned copy instead of re-downloading, which keeps results comparable
and lets a run work without a network connection.

    An existing file is used as is, unless `update` asks for a fresh copy. Download to a

    used (with a warning), like the Overpass locator's stale-cache fallback.

        url (str): URL of the remote resource file.

        update (bool, optional): Download a fresh copy even if the file already exists.
