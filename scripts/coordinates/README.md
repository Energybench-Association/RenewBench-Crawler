# Finding coordinates to combine energy and meteorological data

The majority of energy operators do not provide location information on their energy
generating entities (EGEs) - meaning their units, plants, facilities etc. This poses a
considerable challenge to consolidating the energy with extremely location-dependent weather
data. A combination of various approaches has proven necessary to identify as many coordinates
as possible.

Using various [locator sources](#locator-sources) that provide such coordinate information
for EGEs, different [strategies](#strategies) have been implemented to find matches for
the operator's EGEs. Two [auxiliary sources](#auxiliary-sources) contribute no coordinates
of their own, but enrich the operator's metadata and validate the matches that were found.

## Auxiliary sources

Two further datasets are used that hold no EGE coordinates at all. Instead, they enrich the
operator's metadata before matching and validate the matches afterwards (s. `Used for`).

Both are downloaded into their own subfolder of the `resources_dir` (`eic/`,
`natural_earth/`) on first use and read from there on every run afterwards (s. [running
coordinate finding](#running-coordinate-finding)). Natural Earth is only ever fetched for
operators that report a region at all (e.g. ONS' `nom_estado`), so a `natural_earth/`
folder may well be missing after a run.

## Strategies

1. _ONLY FOR EUROPE (`entsoe`)_: Data enrichment

   Enrich the raw energy data metadata with EIC codes and try to find the parent facility
   (in "entsoe" terms: finding the "production unit" of a "generation unit", or e.g. the
   power plant of a given turbine).

2. _ONLY FOR EUROPE (`entsoe`)_: Matching using the EIC code

   1. Direct matching against codes in GEM and PPM (where/if present).
   2. Parent matching (if parent was found).
   3. Sibling matching: Look at the power plants that have already been matched to see if
     the power plant is related to them.

3. Name matching (exact / fuzzy) with GEM, PPM (Europe)/ OSM-PP, and OSM.

   The entity names from the raw energy source files are tokenized and weighted.
   Proper names are weighted more than other tokens (such as numerals or
   [GENERIC_UNIT_TOKENS](../../rbc/coordinates/mappings.py#L120)). These tokens are then
   matched against the power plant location sources/tables in GEM, PPM, and OSM.
   The best match wins.

   Example:
   Energy entity name "KW Hamm-Uentrop Block 10" is tokenized into the following tokens:
   "KW," "Hamm," "Uentrop," "Block," and "10." Proper names, such as "Hamm" and "Uentrop," are
   weighted with one, while other tokens, such as "Block," "10," and "KW," are weighted with
   0.1.

4. Validation of every match, by fuel type and by region.

   Each candidate is checked against what the operator itself reports. During name
   matching, a candidate whose fuel type or region contradicts that data is rejected
   outright, while one that agrees earns a small score bonus (s.
   [`matcher.py`](../../rbc/coordinates/matcher.py)). After all matching steps, every
   matched EGE — including those matched by EIC code — is checked again, and the outcome
   kept in the `fueltype_match_level` / `region_match_level` columns.

   Fuel types are compared by family (e.g. "hard coal" vs "coal", s.
   [`fuel.py`](../../rbc/coordinates/utils/fuel.py)), regions by point-in-polygon
   containment against Natural Earth's admin-1 polygons, buffered by 20 km to absorb
   border imprecision (offshore wind, hydro plants on border rivers, s.
   [`natural_earth.py`](../../rbc/coordinates/resources/natural_earth.py)). Missing
   information never rejects a match: an operator that reports no region, or a region
   name with no polygon of that name, simply leaves the check unknown.

   A rejected match is excluded from the final `lat`, `lon` and `match_method` columns,
   but its `<loc>.*` columns are kept, so the candidate stays visible for review next to
   the level that rejected it.

For more details, see the modules in the [`rbc/coordinates` folder](../../rbc/coordinates),
in particular the [`orchestrator.py`](../../rbc/coordinates/orchestrator.py).

## Running coordinate finding

The developed coordinate finding can be run directly on the downloaded, raw files of an
energy source using the `coordinate_locator` script:
```bash
$ python -m scripts.coordinates.coordinate_locator -s <SOURCE>
```

Resources shared by all energy sources (e.g. OSM files, the EIC directory) are kept in
the `resources_dir` defined in the [`coordinates` YAML config](../../configs/coordinates/coordinates.yaml).
Put the manually downloaded GEM tracker xlsx files into its `gem/` subfolder. Trackers
missing there fall back to older files from the PPM creator's online cloud storage.

Optional arguments are:

- `-i`: The input dir(s) of the raw files. Per default, the `dst_dir_raw` in the <SOURCE>'s
  YAML config will be used
- `-o`: The output directory for storing extra extracted information (for further metadata
  processing). Per default, a subfolder `coordinates_cli` in the `dst_dir_raw` will be used
  (apart from the processors' `coordinates` folder in the `dst_dir_proc`).
- `--update`: Download fresh copies of every resource in the `resources_dir` (PPM's and
  osm-powerplants' CSVs, GEM's fallback trackers, the EIC registry, Natural Earth registry)
  and re-query the overpass API once per country.

A successful run returns several new files:
- a `coordinates_....csv` with the matched coordinates
- a `name_matches_...csv` with a larger list of all identified potential candidate
  matches in name matching (direct and fuzzy) and reasons for not matching - helpful for
  debugging
- a `map_coordinates.html` map overview of all identified target locations.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This can only be run one source at a time, and only for sources whose raw data are CSV
> files with EGE names (`name_matchable` in OPERATOR_METADATA); others such as AEMO, EIA and
> REI are refused.

### Comparing different coordinate finding runs

As described before, numerous strategies were implemented for matching. If a method is
removed or changed, a stringent comparison is helpful to identify what impact this had on
the outputs. To compare two runs of the same system operator, use the `compare_runs` script:
```bash
$ python -m scripts.coordinates.compare_runs -s <SOURCE>
```

Optional arguments are:

- `-b`: The directory of the first/"before" run. Per default, a folder
  `<dst_dir_raw>/coordinates_cli/archive` will be searched for the most recent CSV files.
- `-a`: The directory of the second/"after" run. Per default, the CSVs in the folder
  `<dst_dir_raw>/coordinates_cli/` will used (direct output location for `coordinate_locator`).
- `--detail`: The number of changed EGEs to list. Defaults to 10.


# Ensuring up-to-date OSM parsing

OSM data is queried for the given operator regions by specifying the area bounds of the
Overpass Turbo API request. Often, the ISO3166-1 alpha-2 country code is definitive enough
in defining this. However, in some instances (i.e. disputed territories), it may not yield
any results. In those cases the so-called OSM country relation IDs can be used instead.

These IDs describe administrative relations with `admin_level=2` and are hard-coded into
the [mappings.py](../../rbc/coordinates/mappings.py) under the global parameter
`COUNTRY_OSM_RELATION_ID_MAP`. However, these IDs may change depending on what the OSM
community decides. Therefore, a script is included to automatically update the
`COUNTRY_OSM_RELATION_ID_MAP`. It can be run whenever required via:
```bash
$ python -m scripts.coordinates.update_osm_relation_ids
```
